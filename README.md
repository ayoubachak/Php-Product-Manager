# Php-Product-Manager
This is a php stock manager done in the fastest time possible (because I had other stuff to do XD)
# To Run
- Create a database named as you wish.. you can modify it from the database.php file in the main folder.
- Run the sql file attached in the directory (gestion_des_stocks.sql).
- Run the database servers.
- create an account, start creating products.
# What's special?
- all the files uploaded are trough ajax, so if you find a problem uploading an image it's probably because it's not supported in your browser.
- all the uploaded files are well managed so that every user will have his own dir on the server, and each image will have a special path.
